An intelligent, production-ready student AI application designed to empower HR professionals and recruiters to screen multiple PDF resumes against a job description, calculate transparent alignment scores, detect critical competency gaps, and export ranked candidate reports.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Recruitment teams often receive hundreds of unstructured resumes for a single job opening. Manual screening is time-consuming, prone to human fatigue, and susceptible to unconscious bias. 

**HireSense AI** automates the preliminary screening workflow by combining **NLP text similarity (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)** with **deterministic, pattern-based skill matching**. It pinpoints exactly which required and preferred competencies a candidate possesses and provides actionable explanations for skill gaps — all without sending candidate data to external paid APIs.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Streamlit**: Interactive, responsive web UI for HR screening.
- **pypdf**: Robust, local extraction of digital text from multi-page PDF resumes.
- **pandas & numpy**: Structured data handling, filtering, sorting, and CSV report generation.
- **scikit-learn**: Sublinear unigram/bigram TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculation.
- **Custom NLP Preprocessor**: Cleans stopwords, normalizes formatting, and preserves technical tokens (e.g., `C++`, `C#`, `.NET`, `Node.js`, `CI/CD`).
- **pytest & unittest**: Automated unit test suite verifying scoring formulas and edge cases.

---

## ✨ Features Breakdown

### 📊 Feature 1: Modern HR Dashboard
- **KPI Metrics Cards**: Total resumes processed, average match score, top candidate score, and count of candidates meeting or exceeding the configurable threshold.
- **Interactive Rankings Table**: Shows candidate name, source filename, overall score, text similarity %, skill match %, matched competencies, and missing skills.
- **Filtering & Search**: Filter candidates by recommendation (`Strong Match`, `Potential Match`, `Low Match`) or search by name and specific skills.
- **Exporting**: One-click download of all candidate rankings and gap details as a clean CSV report.

### 📋 Feature 2: Job Description Input & Benchmark Config
- Paste any job description into an expandable text area.
- Specify **Job Title**, **Required Skills** (mandatory), and **Preferred Skills** (nice-to-have).
- Configure the **Minimum Match Threshold** (default: `70%`).
- **Auto-Detect Skills Button**: Analyzes the JD text and automatically populates required skills from the built-in taxonomy.
- **Pre-loaded Benchmarks**: One-click profile loader for common roles (*Senior AI/ML Engineer*, *Full Stack Python Developer*, *DevOps Specialist*).

### 📤 Feature 3: Resume Upload & PDF Extraction
- Upload multiple PDF resumes simultaneously via drag-and-drop.
- Robust error handling for corrupted files, zero-page PDFs, and empty/scanned images.
- Clear error notification when a PDF contains no extractable digital text (recommending OCR).
- Heuristic candidate name extraction with automatic fallback to sanitized filenames.
- Automatic detection of contact information (Email, Phone number, LinkedIn, GitHub).

### 🧠 Feature 4: Reproducible NLP & Skill Analysis
- **Text Similarity ($70\%$ default)**: Sublinear TF-IDF vectorizer (unigrams + bigrams) computing cosine similarity between candidate resume and job description.
- **Skill Alignment ($30\%$ default)**: Deterministic evaluation against required and preferred skills with case-insensitive regex word boundaries.
- **Documented Formula**:
  $$\text{Overall Score} = (0.70 \times \text{Text Similarity}) + (0.30 \times \text{Skill Match})$$
  *(Weights are customizable in the sidebar).*
- **Documented Fallback**: If no required skills are supplied, HireSense AI automatically extracts skills from the JD text to evaluate candidates, with a transparent note to HR.

### 🔍 Feature 5: Candidate Deep Dive & Skill Gap Analysis
- Individual candidate selector with comprehensive profile overview.
- **Demonstrated Competencies**: Green badges highlighting verified required skills and blue badges for bonus skills.
- **Identified Skill Gaps**: Red badges highlighting missing required competencies — providing specific topics for HR to probe during technical interviews.
- **Categorized Skills Taxonomy**: Visual breakdown of all detected skills across Programming Languages, Web Frameworks, AI/ML, Cloud, Databases, and Soft Skills.
- **Structured Rationale**: Human-readable bulleted explanation detailing why the candidate received their score.
- **Raw Text Inspector**: View the raw extracted digital text from the candidate's PDF.

### 🎨 Feature 6: Visual Design
- Polished navy, white, and slate blue corporate palette (`#0F172A`, `#1E3A8A`, `#2563EB`, `#F8FAFC`).
- Intuitive sidebar navigation and clean tabbed workspace.
- Clear color-coded score indicators (`High >= 70%`, `Mid 55-69%`, `Low < 55%`).

### 🚀 Feature 7: Interactive Demo Mode
- Sidebar toggle to instantly preview the application with **4 realistic benchmark candidates**:
  1. *Dr. Aris Thorne* (Senior AI/ML Engineer — Strong Match)
  2. *Priya Sharma* (Full Stack Python Developer — Potential Match)
  3. *Elena Rostova* (DevOps & Cloud Engineer — Potential Match)
  4. *Marcus Vance* (Frontend UI Developer — Low Match)
- Demo data is stored strictly in memory and labeled with clear illustrative badges, never mixed with real uploaded resumes.

### ⚖️ Feature 9: Privacy, Fairness & Ethics Charter
- **Zero Protected Attributes**: Age, gender, ethnicity, religion, caste, photographs, and names are excluded from scoring.
- **Local & Ephemeral**: Runs entirely on the local machine; resumes are never sent to external cloud APIs or persisted to a database.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Preliminary indicator only; automated rejections are explicitly prohibited.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Ethical AI Statement

HireSense AI does not collect, store, or sell candidate data. Resumes uploaded during a session are processed strictly in memory and are discarded when the session ends. Algorithmic scores are preliminary screening indicators and do not guarantee candidate competence. Human HR discretion is strictly required for all interview and hiring choices.
